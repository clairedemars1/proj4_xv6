to check if an inode has .. and ., do I need to go to it's data blocks, even indirect data blocks

for root direcotyr, do i just need to check it's a directory? 
the inode 1 for me is unallocated, what's up?

why am i seg faulting when checking indirect datablock addresses?

ask nick what he meant about
"""I've found that pointer stuff is wonky
Like, memmove gave me stable results
Instead of implicit struct copies"""

ask them check my ranges
