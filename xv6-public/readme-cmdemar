Scheduler
	basic setup of system calls in regular files and sysproc.c The sysproc.c versions manage error return values
	proc.h - new proc state (priority, time_last_changed, lticks, hticks)
	proc.c - Initialization of new proc state in allocproc(). 
		Implemented syscalls. Each updates the lticks and hticks based on the time_last_changed.
		The ptable knows which priority of processes it should run (ptable.priority_mode). This is 
		set to 2 when a proc calls setpri(2) or when the scheduler finds a proc with priority 2 (not sure why the second is
		necessary, but it didn't work otherwise). It is set to 1 when it 
		is initialized or when a full pass of the ptable is completed where no runnable proc of
		priority 2 was found. 
		The scheduler function now not only checks if there is a runnable process, 
		but if that process is the right priority. 

	test.c
		- i added info to the pstat, to say what priority each process was, and checked I could set it correctly
		- checked the return values for the sys calls
		- checked that a higher priority process did run before a low priority one
